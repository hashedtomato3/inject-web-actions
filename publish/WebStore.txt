Automatically execute pre-defined actions (inserting values, clicking buttons, etc.) when new web page loaded.

- The action can be defined per web site (URL pattern).
- It is a ordered list of firing events (click, focus, etc.) or inserting input values.
- It is defined as function of URL (including query strings) of web site.

For example:
When opened web site of URL=https://www.google.com?injectWebActions=blahblah,
this extention automatically inserts "blahblah" (included in the URL) in search box and clicks search button.

Actions are defined and modified by GUI, and stored in the local storage of the web browser.
These also can be imported by opening the specific URL with query string of action description.
